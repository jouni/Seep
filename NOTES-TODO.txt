Testing
====
* Use Nodeunit for unit testing


Widget ideas
========

Dockable panel (fixed position)
* Dock to one side of the app, and contain any other widgets (inspiration: http://dribble.com/shots/158587-Zendesk-for-iPad/attachments/543)
* Allows scrolling of content below the panel (should not cover scroll bars)
* Auto-hide and reveal on hover (like OS X Dock)

"Spaces"
* Four sections for the app, no more (can maybe have less)
* Switching of the space using arrow keys (+ some modifier)

Dialogs
* Enclose all floating elements inside a wrapper (see Twitter for reference): prevents body scrollbars from appearing if you drag a window out of view


All widgets
=======
* Allow event screening for the server events, e.g. specify which keycodes should trigger a server event or which mouse button should trigger a click event to server




Themes
=====
* Add a reset style (.seep-app * {margin: 0; padding: 0;} etc.)



Breaking connections
=============
* Use HTML5 offline storage to save all modified field values and restore them after a successful reload




Demo apps
=======
* Make the Tasks app look like a notepad with a binder and vertical lines for each row
* Make a slideshow creation app: get photos from Flickr and from hard drive
